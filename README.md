# IntelliCaptions

IntelliCaption is an AI-powered SaaS which is able to transcribe the video and put captions on it seamlessly.

## Introduction

IntelliCaptions is an innovative web app that leverages AI to automatically caption Instagram and YouTube shorts by uploading videos to AWS S3 where the Amazon Transcribe machine learning model identifies languages and generates captions. Users can customize the color, text, and outline of the captions before downloading the accessible, captioned video. Built with React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and ffmpeg, IntelliCaptions delivers an easy-to-use interface that removes barriers for social media creators to reach wider audiences with AI-powered accessibility.

## Functionality
- Upload the files to a secured S3 bucket.
- Let the Amazon Transcribe Model do its magic.
- Change the color and outline color of captions.
- Manually change the data, if the model fails.
- Download the final output video.
